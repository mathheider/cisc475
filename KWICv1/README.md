# David Parnas's KWIC System, version 1
This Java program is based on the KWIC Index Production system described in David L. Parnas, **On the Criteria to be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules**, _Communications of the ACM_ **15**(12), 1972.

This is the first modularization, described as being typical of current approaches.
