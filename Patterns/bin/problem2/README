We decided to distinguish a course, which is a concept that
persists from year to year, from an offering of a course, which occurs
in a single term only.  A Course has a code, number, and name.  A 
CourseOffering has all of those features, and also a building, room,
capacity, etc.

In this version, we used inheritance: a CourseOffering extends a
Course.  After all, a CourseOffering has all fields of a Course, plus
some.  Right?

Wrong.   Would you say a "CourseOffering is a Course"?  No.  It is not
a kind of Course.  It is something different.  Using inheritance in this
way is bound to lead to problems down the road.    

Refactor this code to use the Delegation Pattern rather than inheritance.
