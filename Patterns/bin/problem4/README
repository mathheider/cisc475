This package contains a little implementation of a Directed Graph.
Such a graph consists of a list of Nodes.
Each Node has an ID number and a list of successor (next) nodes.
There is a method to add a new Node to the graph.
After adding a new node, one can add edges by adding successor nodes
to that node.
See and run Test1 for a simple example.

The DirectedGraph class is hard to reuse.   The problem is that the
creation of instances of Node is hard-wired into this class.   The
problem is illustrated when I want to use the DirectedGraph for a
new kind of node, the StringNode.  I can't reuse DirectedGraph for
StringNodes without making a large number of changes to the code.

Refactor this implementation to use the Abstract Factory Pattern.
Instead of creating new nodes directly, the DirectedGraph should
delegate this task to a node factory.  Different node factories can
make different kinds of nodes.  As long as those nodes implement
a given interface, they will all work with the DirectedGraph.
Illustrate the successful refactoring by writing tests that show
DirectedGraph can be used with the original plain nodes and the
new StringNodes with no changes to its code.
